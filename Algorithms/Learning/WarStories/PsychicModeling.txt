Pseudocode for the bookkeeping (excluding the details of the search mechanism).

"""

n - size of set
k - number of slots for number on each ticket
l - number of matching numbers necessary to win the prize

**Not quite right**
The general outline of our searchbased solution still holds for the real problem. All we must fix is which subsets we get credit for covering with a given set of tickets.
